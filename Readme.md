Digging
Diving
Falling
Delving
Dimensioning
Unwrapping
Union skinning
Burying

Comparisons between deeper and deeper
Choices


Mechanics:
Controlled falling
Reach the goal to go deeper
The same level over and over, but deeper
Dungeon crawling


Submarine pressure gets more as deeper
Ore mine expands as it gets deeper
	Sustain the mine

Digging holes

Deeper into space

Avoiding obstacles, as you go deeper difficulty increases
Building something (like a mine/tunnel), as you go deeper, fewer structural supports, more requirements, greater expense, difficulty increases

Minecraft, digging mines
Procedural caving

Deeper and deeper in trouble

Starts out fine, but as you try to maintain state, things get more and more crazy
Until the end

Red November type game
Submarine constantly descending
Various problems happen around the submarine
Must go around and fix them so that the crew does not perish
As depth increases, so does the frequency of issues

Fish-tank theme
	You must go into the depths, of a fishtank
	Avoid evil sea creatures (goldfish)
	Bypass the hazardous sea serpents (snails)
	Navigate the treacherous labrynths (coral and castles)

Pseudo serious sea explorer
	Exploring to find wreck/trench/go deeper
	Oxygen scrubber
	Dive tanks
	Command module
	Hatch (to surface to remove sea creatures)
	Leaks


You choose how deep you go
Must return to surface after you are done
Platformer?
Reward proportional for how deep you start

Perhaps the top level is most difficult
The deeper you go the easier it is to start
And you get perks for starting deeper
But if you want to finish faster, you can start at the top


Sphere platformer
Must find your way to the next layer down
Top down navigation?
Third person navigation?
About unskinning the world by navigating layers down
Must focus on large sphere
and increasingly small sphere
Gravity is odd
How do you take advantage of spherical gravity
Orbit


Counter tower defense?
Control a mob of beasts mining to the next layer down
Each beast is resistant to a particular type of tower
Beasts consume resources
Resources regen over time?
Score based on speed and efficiency
You release beasts in waves
Many paths, only have so much capacity?
Choose which beasts on which path and how many
According to resources
Beast synergies
Speed up
Heal
Shield
Dig fast



Dwarves
Dragons
Mines

Dwarves want to dig
Dragons want to guard their horde
Dwarves must go in groups to make sure they survive
They can take out each dragon
Then progress to the next
Finally digging out the hole at the end
Be careful when you sent your guys though
Because they may not survive

Problems? So many assets



Cave Seal
You are a human/seal morpher
Morph into a seal to swim through the cave
Morph into a human to walk around the cave
Avoid the orcas
Don't drown as a human
Go deeper and deeper

Pro: simple
Con: ai and animation
Also environment and making interesting challenges
